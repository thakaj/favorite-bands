think about setting the first page to render as the home page ==> react router
error message if its an invalid url
add 404 to react routes




Questions for Eri
I want to refactor my code i think i need to look at Form.js as well as App.js 
Form.js=> i want to refactor my onChange functions into one but when i try it doesnt render correctly
it might be a state issue. I would like to change the way my Form.js component works so that it is not its own route
How can i have the state refresh so that my db.json file isnt always being mutated 
App.js=> possibly look over the UseEffect and how its being used to pass a function down to Form.js
Ideas for more functionality=> add a filter to my band page. For a new route maybe a booking page? A calander the user can click on and the user 
can enter info to book time for tutoring. How difficult would that be? If i really wanted it simple i could just have the user click time availability.
If they need to input info i need to change my Form.js i believe.
Have homepage render directly when server runs

i want to add functionality. how can i add more funcitonality to my project as it is


eri recom

bandpage=> css display flex box youtube resources 
error handle will probably be an if statement so i dont get bad data submited => lookup error handling with json
filter by onChange bring state. filter it all by name

// Notes from Jenn
//UseEffect to fetch db.json at this parent level to pass down info as props
// for the css add a class name to the components top < />
//use Css to make my card table. => Jenn used semantic UI from React
// suggested i add a filter to my band page as practice and functionality !!!
// the form needs to update state as well as updating db.json
//i need to make a post request so that the data gets added to db.json
//i want my post request to update the state of the bands so it is added to the array
//the test is to see if i refresh the data is still avaiable 
//set homepage to be the default that loads when the project renders


json-server --watch db.json --port 8000

//notes 

//porbably render BandCards component 
//may want to use a table to illustrate all the band cards
//something like whats bellow but with the component <BandCard id={id} /> probably have to pass down props from the parent <BandPage/> to <BandcCard/>
// going to call the data from db.json. maybe create a variable and set it equal to an array then set the db within the array? possibly
// always need to provide a function definition, not a function invocation to our event handlers => refrence Event handling in react
//React will only update state if a new object/array is passed to setState
//Again, to repeat! React will only re-render our component when we set state with a new value; so we need to create a 
//new copy of our original array to pass to the setter function, rather than mutating the original 
//array directly and passing a reference to the original array.
//Filter notes
// Remember, .filter returns a new array that is a shortened version of the elements in the original array. It expects a callback that will
//return either true or false. For all elements of the original array where the callback returns true, add those elements to the new array. For
//all elements that return false, don't add them to the new array.
//Notes on making setting state
//1.import useState hook
//2. set up iniital state
//  2.a function variable(){   const [isVariable, setVariable] = setState(dataType)}
//3. Use state variable in component {isVariable}
//4. call setter function in a function {setVariable}



//Notes
//porbably have a component inside of it
//This page will require me to create a submit form => refrence handling events in react for brief examples
//use the form element => use the onSubmit event listener => must remember to use event.prevent default while using onSubmit
//As a rule of thumb, any time you need to set state based on the current value of state, you should use the callback syntax.
//example
// function increment() {
//     setCount((currentCount) => currentCount + 1);
//     setCount((currentCount) => currentCount + 1);
//   } 
//React will only update state if a new object/array is passed to setState
//Again, to repeat! React will only re-render our component when we set state with a new value; so we need to create a 
//new copy of our original array to pass to the setter function, rather than mutating the original 
//array directly and passing a reference to the original array.
//Cheat Sheet for Array Methods
//Add: use the spread operator ([...])
// Remove: use .filter
// Update: use .map
